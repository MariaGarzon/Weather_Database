# Purpose of Analysis

This project consisted of three technical analyses.

  Analysis 1: 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes were generated to retrieve the nearest cities using an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. Then, a DataFrame     was created containing Latitude, longitude, Maximum temperature, Percent humidity, Percent cloudiness, Wind speed and current Weather description for each     city. 
  
  Analysis 2: Created a Customer Travel Destinations Map by using input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then used those preferences to       identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, showed those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
 
 Analysis 3: Created a Travel Itinerary Map by using the Google Directions API that shows the route between four cities chosen from the customerâ€™s possible 
     travel destinations. Then, created a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary.
